Significance of State = None

1. If the state parameter is not provided when calling the sample_action method, it will remain as None => agent will not use any specific state information when sampling an action. Instead, it will directly reset the environment and sample an action based on the current observation.

2. The state parameter is useful when we want to provide a specific state to the agent for action selection. This can be beneficial in scenarios where we want the agent to make decisions based on a specific state representation or when we want to continue the agent's behavior from a specific state in the environment.

3. If we have specific requirements for the state parameter or if we want the agent to utilize a specific state for action selection, we can pass the desired state value when calling the sample_action method. Otherwise, leaving it as None will result in the agent making decisions based solely on the current observation.
