To do:

 -  tune the hyperparameters of the PPO algorithm and the training process to get good performance.
 -  Specify suitable reward function that correctly represents the task(s) for the agent to learn the desired behaviour.
 -  Set appropriate observation and action spaces for the agent. 

Observation spaces: what agent can observe from the environment

Action Spaces: Actions the agent can take
